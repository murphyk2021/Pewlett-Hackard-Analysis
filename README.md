# Module 7 Challenge
## Employee Database with SQL
- - -

## Overview of the Challenge
In this module challenge students were introduced to SQL, Structured Query Language.  SQL is used to retrieve and manipulate data from many separate data tables by identifying and linking common information shared between them.  To practice with this process we first learned how to use Quick DBD to create a "road map" of our data.  This is an extremely helpful organizational step as it allows us to visualize how all of our data tables are related to each other before we start trying to extract information. See example below:

Once we had organized our data in our mind we were asked to help "Bobby" of the fictional company, Pewlett Hackard, determine how many employees are eligible to retire now or will be eligible in the near future.  With this information Pewlett Hackard can plan to post new job openings according to the retirement of current employees and, ideally, set up a successful mentorship program between the retiring employee and the new hire.  This would ensures a smooth transition for the company as the new employee would have excellent training and the retiree would have the opportunity to ease into full retirement over time.  

## Results and Summary
 
It turns out of the roughly 300,000 employees at Pewlett Hackard, **over 90,000** are eligible for retirement.  It will be very important to coordinate these with the hiring process!  They may also want to consider some promotions as over 60% of all retirement age employees are in senior positions (accounting for nearly 20% of all Pewlett Hackard employees).

Although Pewlett Hackard should be able to establish some mentorship relationships between the newly hired/promoted employees and the veteran employees there simply are not enough mentors for a 1-to-1 arrangement.  Pewlett Hackard may need to consider if it would be appropriate to assign multiple trainees to each mentor.  If not, they may need to arrange a staggered hiring process or onboarding program to create an effective training system for their employees.

### Main Takeaways:
 - Nearly 30% of all Pewlett Hackard employees are eligble for retirement
 - More than 60% of the employees preparing for retirement are in senior positions
 - There are not enough employees approaching retirement age to mentor all of the new hires that will be required
 - Pewlett Hackard better start hiring right away!
