# Module 7 Challenge
## Employee Database with SQL
- - -

## Overview of the Challenge
In this module challenge students were introduced to SQL, Structured Query Language.  SQL is used to retrieve and manipulate data from many separate data tables by identifying and linking common information shared between them.  To practice with this process we first learned how to use Quick DBD to create a "road map" of our data.  This is an extremely helpful organizational step as it allows us to visualize how all of our data tables are related to each other before we start trying to extract information. See example below:

Once we have an idea of how our data is related we were asked to help "Bobby" of the fictional company, Pewlett Hackard, predict how many employees will be eligible to retire in the near future.  With this information, Pewlett Hackard can plan to post new job openings according to the retirement of current employees and set up a successful mentorship program between the retiring employee and the new hire.  This ensures that the new employee will have excellent training and the retiree will have the opportunity to ease into full retirement over time.  

## Results
It turns out of the roughly 300,000 employees at Pewlett Hackard, **over 90,000** are eligible for retirement.  It will be very important to coordinate these with the hiring process!  They may also want to consider some promotions as nearly 65% of all retirement age employees are in senior positions (accounting for nearly 20% of all Pewlett Hackard employees).
